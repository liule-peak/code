/**
 *  @file    BlockRecord.h
 *  @author  Tomer Golomb (golombt)
 *  @version 1.0
 *
 *  @brief defines an interface for BlockRecord class.
 *  BlockRecord is a buffer that represents a blockchain record.
 *  Each record is composed from two fields: <From><Content>
 *  Where <From> is the record owner (the one that created it).
 *  Where <Content> is the record content (the one that created it).
 *  For example, in bitcoin <From> is the public key of the one performing the transaction
 *  and <Content> is the transaction (The receiver and how much money to transfer).
