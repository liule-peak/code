This package includes the implementation of JumpTracer anomaly detection.
JumpTracer is a extended markov chain over a program control-flow events.
It allows for efficiently computing the probability for a jump sequence during the execution of a program.
JumpTableUtilities are used to as a bridge to connect JumpTracer to CIoTA functionalities.
