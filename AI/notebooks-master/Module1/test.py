# ```datasets``` is a class of the ```torchvision``` package (see [torchvision.datasets](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/datasets.html)) and deals with data loading. It integrates a multi-threaded loader that fetches images from the disk, groups them in mini-batches and serves them continously to the GPU right after each _forward_/_backward_ pass through the network.
# 
# Images needs a bit of preparation before passing them throught the network. They need to have all the same size $224\times 224 \times 3$ plus some extra formatting done below by the normalize transform (explained later).

The images have to be loaded in to a range of [0, 1] and then normalized using `mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]` and `std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`.

# ### Modifying the last layer and setting the gradient false to all layers

# We'll learn about what these different blocks do later in the course. For now, it's enough to know that:
# 
# - Convolution layers are for finding small to medium size patterns in images -- analyzing the images locally
# - Dense (fully connected) layers are for combining patterns across an image -- analyzing the images globally
# - Pooling layers downsample -- in order to reduce image size and to improve invariance of learned features

# ![vgg16](https://dataflowr.github.io/notebooks/Module1/img/vgg16.png)

# In this practical example, our goal is to use the already trained model and just change the number of output classes. To this end we replace the last ```nn.Linear``` layer trained for 1000 classes to ones with 2 classes. In order to freeze the weights of the other layers during training, we set the field ```required_grad=False```. In this manner no gradient will be computed for them during backprop and hence no update in the weights. Only the weights for the 2 class layer will be updated.

# ## 4. Viewing model prediction (qualitative analysis)
# 
# The most important metrics for us to look at are for the validation set, since we want to check for over-fitting.
# 
# With our first model we should try to overfit before we start worrying about how to handle that - there's no point even thinking about regularization, data augmentation, etc if you're still under-fitting! (We'll be looking at these techniques after the 2 weeks break...)
# 
# 
# As well as looking at the overall metrics, it's also a good idea to look at examples of each of:
# 
#    1. A few correct labels at random
#    2. A few incorrect labels at random
#    3. The most correct labels of each class (ie those with highest probability that are correct)
#    4. The most incorrect labels of each class (ie those with highest probability that are incorrect)
#    5. The most uncertain labels (ie those with probability closest to 0.5).
# 
# In general, these are particularly useful for debugging problems in the model. Since our model is very simple, there may not be too much to learn at this stage...

# # Conclusion
# 
# What did we do in the end? A simple logistic regression! If the connection is unclear, we'll explain it on a much simpler example in the next course. 
# 
# We probably killed a fly with a sledge hammer!
# 
# In our case, the sledge hammer is VGG pretrained on Imagenet, a dataset containing a lot of pictures of cats and dogs. Indeed, we saw that without modification the network was able to predict dog and cat breeds. Hence it is not very surprising that the features computed by VGG are very accurate for our classification task. In the end, we need to learn only the parameters of the last linear layer, i.e. 8194 parameters (do not forget the bias $2\times 4096+2$). Indeed, this can be done on CPU without any problem.
# 
# Nevertheless, this example is still instructive as it shows all the necessary steps in a deep learning project. Here we did not struggle with the learning process of a deep network, but we did all the preliminary engineering tasks: dowloading a dataset, setting up the environment to use a GPU, preparing the data, computing the features with a pretrained VGG, saving them on your drive so that you can use them for a later experiment... These steps are essential in any deep learning project and a necessary requirement before having fun playing with network architectures and understanding the learning process.
